5.  **Module Usage:**

    *   **User-api:** This module defines the core interfaces for interacting with the user management system. Other modules depend on these interfaces to implement user management functionality. To use it in an external project, add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

        ```gradle
        dependencies {
            implementation 'it.water.user:User-api:3.0.0' // Replace 3.0.0 with the actual version
        }
        ```

        Example Usage:

        ```java
        import it.water.user.api.UserApi;
        import it.water.user.model.WaterUser;

        public class MyComponent {
            private UserApi userApi;

            public MyComponent(UserApi userApi) {
                this.userApi = userApi;
            }

            public void createUser(String username, String password, String email) {
                WaterUser user = new WaterUser();
                user.setUsername(username);
                // Set other user properties
                userApi.register(user);
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **User-model:** This module defines the `WaterUser` entity and related constants. It's a dependency for modules that need to work with user data. Add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

        ```gradle
        dependencies {
            implementation 'it.water.user:User-model:3.0.0' // Replace 3.0.0 with the actual version
        }
        ```

        Example Usage:

        ```java
        import it.water.user.model.WaterUser;

        public class MyComponent {
            public void processUser(WaterUser user) {
                String username = user.getUsername();
                // ... do something with the user data
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **User-service:** This module provides the core implementation of the user management functionality.  It can be used as a standalone service or integrated into a larger application.  To use it, you would typically need to instantiate the required classes (e.g., `UserServiceImpl`, `UserSystemServiceImpl`) and configure their dependencies. You would also need to configure the JPA persistence unit to connect to your database.

    *   **User-service-spring:** This module provides a Spring-based implementation of the user service. It leverages Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA to simplify development and deployment. To use it, include the module as a dependency and configure your Spring Boot application:

        ```gradle
        dependencies {
            implementation 'it.water.user:User-service-spring:3.0.0' // Replace 3.0.0 with the actual version
        }
        ```

        Example:
        In a Spring Boot application, you can enable the User-service-spring module by including the necessary dependencies and configuring the application properties:

        ```java
        @SpringBootApplication
        @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"it.water.user", "your.other.packages"}) // Ensure User-service-spring components are scanned
        @EnableJpaRepositories("it.water.user.repository") // Enable JPA repositories
        public class MyApplication {

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
            }
        }
        ```

        application.properties:

        ```properties
        spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
        spring.datasource.username=sa
        spring.datasource.password=
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testdb
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
        ```

    *   **User-service-integration:** This module is primarily used for integration testing and doesn't typically need to be included as a dependency in other projects.

## Functional Analysis

### 1. Main Responsibilities of the System

The primary responsibility of the "User" system is to manage the lifecycle of user accounts within the "Water" ecosystem. It orchestrates user registration, authentication, authorization, and account management. The system provides foundational services for user data persistence, role and permission management, and secure password handling. It also manages user activation and deactivation, password reset workflows, and account unregistration processes. The core abstraction it provides is the `WaterUser` entity, which represents a user within the system.

### 2. Problems the System Solves

The system solves the common challenges associated with user management in web applications and systems. It addresses the need for secure user registration and authentication, providing mechanisms for verifying user identities and protecting user data. It simplifies the process of managing user roles and permissions, allowing developers to easily control access to different parts of the application. The system also solves the problem of password management, providing secure password hashing and reset workflows. Furthermore, it addresses the need for compliance with data privacy regulations by providing mechanisms for account unregistration and data deletion.

### 3. Interaction of Modules and Components

The modules within the "User" system interact in a layered fashion. The `User-api` module defines the interfaces that other modules implement. The `User-service` module provides the core implementation of these interfaces, orchestrating the various components involved in user management. The `UserRepositoryImpl` component handles data access, interacting with the database to persist and retrieve user data. The `UserAuthenticationProvider` handles user authentication, verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens. The `UserServiceImpl` implements the high-level user management operations, delegating to other components as needed. The `UserRestControllerImpl` exposes the user management functionality through a RESTful API. The `EncryptionUtil` provides password hashing and encryption services. Dependency Injection (especially within the `User-service-spring` module) facilitates loose coupling between components.

### 4. User-Facing vs. System-Facing Functionalities

The "User" system provides both user-facing and system-facing functionalities.

*   **User-Facing Functionalities:** These are the functionalities that are directly exposed to end-users through the REST API. They include:
    *   User registration: Allows users to create new accounts.
    *   User login: Allows users to authenticate and access the system.
    *   Password reset: Allows users to reset their passwords if they forget them.
    *   Account management: Allows users to update their account information.
    *   Account unregistration: Allows users to delete their accounts.
*   **System-Facing Functionalities:** These are the functionalities that are used internally by other system components. They include:
    *   User data persistence: Allows the system to store and retrieve user data.
    *   Role and permission management: Allows the system to control access to different parts of the application based on user roles.
    *   User activation and deactivation: Allows the system to enable or disable user accounts.
    *   Authentication and authorization: Provides the underlying mechanisms for verifying user identities and controlling access to resources.

The `UserRestControllerImpl` and `UserSpringRestControllerImpl` classes define the REST API endpoints that expose the user-facing functionalities. The other components, such as `UserRepositoryImpl`, `UserAuthenticationProvider`, and `UserServiceImpl`, provide the underlying system-facing functionalities.

Additionally, the `WaterUser` entity systematically applies JPA annotations to map the class to a database table, ensuring consistent data persistence across all implementing classes and extending classes. Lombok annotations are also applied to generate boilerplate code.

## Architectural Patterns and Design Principles Applied

*   **Layered Architecture:** The project follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into API, service, data access, and model layers.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Spring (in `User-service-spring`) is used for dependency injection, promoting loose coupling and testability.
*   **Interface-Based Design:** The project uses interfaces extensively to define contracts between components, allowing for flexibility and testability.
*   **RESTful API:** The `UserRestApi` and `UserRestControllerImpl` components expose user management functionality through a RESTful API.
*   **Repository Pattern:** The `UserRepository` interface and its implementations encapsulate data access logic, separating it from the service layer.
*   **Service Pattern:** The `UserService` and `UserSystemService` interfaces and their implementations encapsulate business logic, separating it from the API and data access layers.
*   **Configuration via Properties:** Configuration options (e.g., registration enabled, activation URL) are managed through application properties, allowing for easy customization.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** The use of `ComponentRegistry` suggests a plugin architecture, where different components can be registered and accessed dynamically.
*   **Security:** The project incorporates security measures such as password hashing and JWT-based authentication.
*   **Testability:** The project is designed with testability in mind, using interfaces, dependency injection, and mocking frameworks to facilitate unit and integration testing.
*   **Maven Publication:** The `publishing` block in each `build.gradle` file indicates that the modules are designed to be published to a Maven repository for reuse in other projects.
*   **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Clear separation of concerns is maintained between different modules and components, making the project more modular and maintainable.
*   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code, adhering to the DRY principle.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system uses roles to manage user permissions and control access to resources.
*   **Interceptor Pattern:** The `Core-interceptors` dependency suggests the use of interceptors for cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, or validation.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:**  The email notification service and the registration process imply an event-driven approach where user actions trigger asynchronous events like sending emails.

## Code Quality Analysis

The SonarQube analysis reveals a generally healthy codebase for the "User" project:

*   **Bugs:** 0 - No bugs were identified, indicating a stable codebase.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** 0 - No vulnerabilities were found, demonstrating a secure design.
*   **Code Smells:** 0 - Absence of code smells suggests clean and maintainable code.
*   **Code Coverage:** 80.7% - A high percentage of code coverage ensures most of the codebase is well-tested.
*   **Duplication:** 0.0% - No duplicated code was detected, indicating adherence to the DRY principle.

These metrics suggest the project is well-maintained, reliable, and secure. The high code coverage contributes to the project's robustness and reduces the risk of introducing defects.
